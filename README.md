# Welcome to the College Football Dashboard!
The link to the report is in this repository. If you do not have Power BI, I provided screenshots of each page with short descriptions here.<br/><br/>

The datasets I used were from https://collegefootballdata.com/ <br/>
It includes all FBS teams and every FBS game played since 2013. <br/>
I chose to remove the 2020 season data because most teams did not play all of their games and some teams did not play any games. <br/> <br/>

# Overview Page: <br/>
Shows general College Football information as a whole and also highlights how strong the Power 5 teams are compared to the others.
